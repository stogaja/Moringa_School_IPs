### Nairobi Hospital Hypothyroidism Test

#### a) Specifying the Question
###### To build a model that determines whether sypmtoms of a patient suggest that the patient has hypothyroidism.

#### b) Defining the Metric for Success
###### Our model having an accuracy above 90%.

#### c) Understanding the Context
###### Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.

###### Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease.

###### Accurate thyroid function tests are available to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is usually simple, safe and effective once you and your doctor find the right dose for you.

Hypothyroidism signs and symptoms may include:

Fatigue
Increased sensitivity to cold
Constipation
Dry skin
Weight gain
Puffy face
Hoarseness
Muscle weakness
Elevated blood cholesterol level
#### d) Recording the Experimental Design
###### Application of techniques such as exploratory data analysis, such as Univariate, Bivariate, in this study to determine the relationships and differences between different variables. We shall also use Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine to make predictions.

#### e) Data Relevance
