The analysis aims to study the factors that affecting the price of houses. we are required to do this using information sourced from real estate properties that was collected over a few years.

### b) Defining the Metric for Success
The metric for success of the project is to build a model that can accurately predict the sale price of a house with a high level of accuracy.

### c) Understanding the Context
Hass Consulting Company is a real estate firm that offers investment-grade developments all over Nairobi City. The developments offered have been conceptualized by their development team to be high quality assets using a data-driven approach in planning and design, that gears property for high rental returns and an escalated rate of capital growth.

### d) Recording the Experimental Design
Perform your EDA

#### 5 Performing regression analysis.

Incorporate categorical independent variables into your models.

Check for multicollinearity.

Perform regression analysis using the following techniques and access their performance, giving a recommendation of the best:

#### 1.Multiple Linear Regression

#### 2.Quantile Regression

#### 3.Ridge Regression

#### 4.Lasso Regression

#### 5.Elastic Net Regression

Provide a recommendation based on your analysis.

Create residual plots for your models, and assess heteroskedasticity using Barlett's test.

Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements in model improvement.
