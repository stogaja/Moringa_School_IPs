# HYPOTHESIS TESTING & EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON AUTOLIB

## WHAT IS THE PROJECT ABOUT?

Autolib is an electric car sharing company. I examined the blue car claim shown in the dataset above. 
The main purpose of this study is to identify interesting periods in the dataset by a sampling method of choice. Then run the hypothesis test according to the claim. 
The main question is **whether the total of blue cars in the area of zip code 75015 is different from that of zip code 75017.**

The code work on my research is presented above and the following is a snippet of some of the pearson's correlation:
